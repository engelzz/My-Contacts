Introducing the user management API, a  tool for managing user data with ease. Developed with Node.js and Express, this API allows for easy creation, deletion, updating, and searching of users based on their emails, phone numbers, and names.

The user management API is built of PostgreSQL, a  open-source relational database management system. This ensures that your user data is secure, scalable, and always available.
